# MonteCarloMethod



 Why do we multiply the value from step 5 above by 4? We targetted 1/4 of a circle.

 What do you observe in the output when running your program with parameters of
     increasing size? A more accurate estimation

 If you run the program multiple times with the same parameter, does the
     output remain the same? Why or why not? You get different results because of the random nature of the test.

 Find a parameter that requires multiple seconds of run time. What is that
     parameter? How accurate is the estimated value of ? I tried 100,000,000, it was accurate to 4 decimal places.

 Research one other use of Monte-Carlo methods. Record it in your exercise
     submission and be prepared to discuss it in class. I did a dice roll monte carlo method to estimate the probability of the values.
     Seven had the highest probability because there are the most combinations that can result in 7. With decending probabilities on
     either side of 7.
